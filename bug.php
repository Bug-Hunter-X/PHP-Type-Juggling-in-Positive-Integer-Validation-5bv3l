This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's type juggling.  The function `checkValue` intends to verify if a given value is a positive integer. However, due to loose typing, it will incorrectly return `true` for strings that can be interpreted as numbers. For example,  `checkValue('123abc')` will return `true` because the string '123' is evaluated as an integer before the comparison.
