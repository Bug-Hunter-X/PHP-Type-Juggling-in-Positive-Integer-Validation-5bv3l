This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to type juggling. The `bug.php` file contains a function that attempts to validate positive integers, but due to PHP's loose type system, it incorrectly accepts strings that begin with numeric characters. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.php`, uses strict type checking to resolve this issue.
